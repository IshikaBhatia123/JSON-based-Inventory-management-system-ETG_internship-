# JSON-based-Inventory-management-system-ETG_internship-
This repository is having all the codes along with json files for making an inventory management system during ETG AI/ML internship.
The main purpose of this project is to develop a computerized for a "Beauty and Hygeine departmental store" to organize their daily activities like billing, maintaining stock etc more efficiently.
### The project will serve the following objectives:
1)To design a system that will accurately compute total bill to be paid by customers and is less time consuming.
2)To create a computerized system that will be used to manage the stock of items effectively.
3)To implement a system that can be used to update /modify the stock of available products.
### I have made this inventory management system using NoSQL based database. 
I have made this project in python and have used json file system for making this project. 
### The following are the features of this project:
#####       a) Display the inventory of available products in the store including its:
         -> Every item has its unique product id
         -> Name of the product
         -> Price
         -> Quantity available in the stock
         -> Pack size per product
         -> Expiry date of the product
#####      b)  Add items in the inventory:
         -> Product id the of the item is checked . If the item is already available , it updates the quantity of that product. Otherwise adds a new product in the inventory.
#####       c)  Delete an item/product of user entered product id from the inventory.
#####       d)  Generate bill
         -> It generates bill with accurate amount to be paid by customer after discount , when a customer purchases an item
#####       e)  It updates the quantity of the product after every every purchase.
#####       f)  Creating new sales file:
         -> It stores all the transactions after a purchase in a new sales.json file along with a unique transaction id , customer details , name of product purchased, Quantity               purchased, Amount paid by customer , Date and time of purchase.
### Conclusion:
This project contains limited features but the essential ones for effective and efficient management of a departmental store in a computerized manner .
